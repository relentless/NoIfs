Why Ifs Bad

- Not *always* bad..
- Maintenance/readability problem
- Nested and multiple If/Elses real problem
- Switch statement has same problems
- Conditional operator has same problems

- Cyclomatic Complexity counts code paths (conditionals)
- Anti-If Campaign: http://cirillocompany.de/pages/anti-if-campaign


- Conditionals over types -> polymorphism
- Code in different places same except for conditional -> predicate
- Options hard coded -> dictionary
- Overly imperative style -> declarative style

Quotes

Michael feathers: "Control structures have been around nearly as long as programming but it's hard for me to see them as more than an annoyance.  Over and over again, I find that better code has fewer if-statements, fewer switches, and fewer loops."

Phil Haack: "We don’t need to try and kill every if statement, but perhaps the more we do, the better our code becomes."


Alternatives

- Dictionaries
- Strategy Pattern
- Object Orientation (Replace Conditional with Polymorphism)
- High order functions (e.g. Predicates)
- Filtering (e.g. where function)
